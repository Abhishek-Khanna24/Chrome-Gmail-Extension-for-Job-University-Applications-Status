# Chrome-Gmail-Extension-for-Unsuccessful-Applications
Chrome extension which reads the email related with Job or University applications. Shows the result either Accepted or rejected without going through the whole email(Lowers anxiety, I suppose).

We'll create extension for Chrome with these core technologies from web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The very first thing we'll need to create is a manifest file named manifest.json. This manifest is nothing more than a metadata file in JSON format that contains properties like your extension's name, description, version number and so on.
