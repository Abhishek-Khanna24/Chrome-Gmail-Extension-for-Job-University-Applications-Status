# Chrome-Gmail-Extension-for-Unsuccessful-Applications
Chrome extension which reads the email related with Job or University applications. Shows the result either Accepted or rejected without going through the whole email(Lowers anxiety, I suppose).

We'll create extension for Chrome with these core technologies from web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The very first thing we'll need to create is a manifest file named manifest.json. This manifest is nothing more than a metadata file in JSON format that contains properties like your extension's name, description, version number and so on.
At a high level, we will use it to declare to Chrome what the extension is going to do, and what permissions it requires in order to do those things. To learn more about the manifest, read the Manifest File [Format documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest)
